Troubleshooting



Everything I do in the editor or project manager appears delayed by one frame.



The grid disappears and meshes turn black when I rotate the 3D camera in the editor.



The editor or project takes a very long time to start.



Editor tooltips in the Inspector and Node docks blink when they're displayed.



The Godot editor appears frozen after clicking the system console.



Some text such as &quot;NO DC&quot; appears in the top-left corner of the project manager and editor window.



The project window appears blurry, unlike the editor.



The project window doesn't appear centered when I run the project.



The project works when run from the editor, but fails to load some files when running from an exported copy.
